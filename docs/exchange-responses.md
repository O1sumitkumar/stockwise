# NSE / BSE responses and test fixtures

The `nse`, `bse` and `exchange` data providers ([data-providers.md](data-providers.md#nse-and-bse))
read the JSON endpoints behind nseindia.com and bseindia.com. Those endpoints
are undocumented and change without notice, so StockWise pins down what it
expects in two places:

- **This page** lists every endpoint and the fields StockWise reads. Fields
  not listed are ignored, so new fields never break anything.
- **Fixtures** in [`src/providers/fixtures/`](../src/providers/fixtures/) hold
  one recorded-style response per endpoint. Parser tests run against them;
  no test touches the network.

## Fixture format

A fixture is the response body exactly as the endpoint sends it (JSON, or CSV
for the downloads), **trimmed and anonymised**:

- Keep the fields StockWise reads (below) and a few neighbours, so the
  fixture still looks like the real thing. Drop long arrays down to two or
  three entries.
- Replace real-time values with plausible made-up ones. Fixtures are test
  data, not market data: never commit a full live response (the exchanges'
  terms restrict redistributing their data), and never commit cookies,
  headers or anything tied to a session.
- Keep the quirks: numbers sent as strings (`"lowerCP": "1307.20"`, BSE's
  `"1,451.65"`), the misspelt `grapthData`, BSE's JSON-inside-a-string `Data`,
  NSE's IST-as-UTC chart stamps. Those are what the parsers must survive.
- Name it `<exchange>_<endpoint>.json` (or `.csv`) and load it with
  `include_str!` in the parser's tests.

The fixtures shipped with the first release of these providers are modelled
on the shapes these endpoints have long returned (and that open-source NSE/BSE
clients parse); they were not captured from a live session by the code in this
repository. When a live response differs, update the fixture and the parser
together and note the date here.

### Recording a fresh response

1. Open the page that shows the data in your browser — for example
   `https://www.nseindia.com/get-quotes/equity?symbol=RELIANCE` — with the
   developer tools' Network tab open, filtered to `api`.
2. Click the request (`quote-equity?symbol=RELIANCE`) and copy the response
   body.
3. Trim and anonymise it as above, save it under `src/providers/fixtures/`,
   and run `cargo test providers`.

Use your browser for this, as a person visiting the site would; don't script
requests around the exchanges' bot protection.

## NSE (`https://www.nseindia.com`)

Every API call follows one load of the home page (`/`) for session cookies.

| Endpoint | Fixture | Fields read |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `/api/quote-equity?symbol=RELIANCE` | `nse_quote_equity.json` | `info.companyName`; `priceInfo.lastPrice`, `change`, `pChange`, `previousClose`, `open`, `intraDayHighLow.min`/`max`, `weekHighLow.min`/`max`, `lowerCP`/`upperCP` (strings). `{}` (or only `msg`/`info`) = unknown symbol; no `priceInfo` next to other keys = format change |
| `/api/quote-equity?symbol=RELIANCE&section=trade_info` | `nse_trade_info.json` | `marketDeptOrderBook.tradeInfo.totalTradedVolume` (lakh shares), `.totalMarketCap` (₹ crore); `securityWiseDP.deliveryToTradedQuantity` (%) |
| `/api/allIndices` | `nse_all_indices.json` | `data[]`: `indexSymbol` (or `index`), `last`, `variation`, `percentChange`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `previousClose`, `yearHigh`, `yearLow` |
| `/api/equity-stockIndices?index=NIFTY%2050` | `nse_equity_stock_indices.json` | `name`; `data[]`: `priority` (1 = the index's own row), `symbol`, `lastPrice`, `change`, `pChange`, `open`, `dayHigh`, `dayLow`, `previousClose`, `yearHigh`, `yearLow`, `totalTradedVolume` (shares), `meta.companyName` |
| `/api/chart-databyindex?index=RELIANCEEQN` (`?index=NIFTY%2050&indices=true` for an index) | `nse_chart_databyindex.json` | `grapthData`: `[epoch ms, price]` pairs, pre-open points tagged `"PO"`. The stamps are IST wall-clock time written as UTC; StockWise detects and corrects that |
| `/api/historical/cm/equity?symbol=RELIANCE&series=["EQ","BE"]&from=24-10-2024&to=24-10-2025` | `nse_historical_equity.json` | `data[]`: `CH_TIMESTAMP` (`2025-10-24`, or `mTIMESTAMP` `24-Oct-2025`), `CH_SERIES`, `CH_OPENING_PRICE`, `CH_TRADE_HIGH_PRICE`, `CH_TRADE_LOW_PRICE`, `CH_CLOSING_PRICE`, `CH_TOT_TRADED_QTY`. At most a year per request. On HTTP 404 StockWise tries `/api/historicalOR/generateSecurityWiseHistoricalData` (same fields) |
| `/api/historical/indicesHistory?indexType=NIFTY%2050&from=...&to=...` | `nse_indices_history.json` | `data.indexCloseOnlineRecords[]`: `EOD_TIMESTAMP` (`24-OCT-2025`), `EOD_OPEN_INDEX_VAL`, `EOD_HIGH_INDEX_VAL`, `EOD_LOW_INDEX_VAL`, `EOD_CLOSE_INDEX_VAL`; `data.indexTurnoverRecords[]`: `HIT_TIMESTAMP`, `HIT_TRADED_QTY` |
| `/api/search/autocomplete?q=reliance` | `nse_autocomplete.json` | `symbols[]`: `symbol`, `symbol_info`, `type` (only `equity` kept) |
| `https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/equities/EQUITY_L.csv` | inline in the tests | Columns `SYMBOL` and `NAME OF COMPANY`; search fallback, kept on disk for a day |

Prices of 0 (or `"-"`) mean "none" and are read as missing, never as ₹0.

## BSE (`https://api.bseindia.com/BseIndiaAPI/api`)

No cookies; calls carry `Referer` and `Origin` of `https://www.bseindia.com`.

| Endpoint | Fixture | Fields read |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ListofScripData/w?Group=&Scripcode=&industry=&segment=Equity&status=Active` | `bse_scrip_list.json` | A list (older answers: `{"Table": [...]}`) of `SCRIP_CD` (string or number), `scrip_id`, `Scrip_Name` (or `Issuer_Name`). Kept on disk for a day; maps `RELIANCE.BO` to `500325` and serves search |
| `getScripHeaderData/w?Debtflag=&scripcode=500325&seriesid=` | `bse_header.json` | `CurrRate.LTP`, `.Chg`, `.PcChg`; `Header.PrevClose`, `.Open`, `.High`, `.Low`, `.LTP`; `Cmpname.FullN`. Numbers are strings, sometimes with thousands separators. Neither `Header` nor `CurrRate` = format change |
| `StockReachGraph/w?scripcode=500325&flag=0&fromdate=&todate=&seriesid=` | `bse_stock_reach_graph.json` | `Data`: a JSON list sent as a string (or a list) of `{dttm: "Fri Oct 24 2025 09:15:00" (IST), vale1: price}` |
| `StockPriceCSVDownload/w?pageType=0&rbType=D&Scode=500325&FDates=24/10/2024&TDates=24/10/2025` | `bse_stock_prices.csv` | CSV columns found by name: `Date` (`24-October-2025`), `Open Price`, `High Price`, `Low Price`, `Close Price`, `No.of Shares` |
